# ABFolio

ABFolio is an prototype of a stock-market portfolio management system.

It is purely console based, as a result it does not contain a GUI.

It is interesting to notice that ABFolio works with Bonds, Futures and 

other asset classes that are not easy to fetch pricing data this is 

possible due to the Investpy library.
